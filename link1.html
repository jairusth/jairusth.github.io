	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
	<h3><p>I actually prefer to work on cars. But I enjoy making art because it allows me to get really creative, so I do sometimes make art in my freetime when I am not ding anything important. Most of the programs I use are Adobe Premire, Photoshop, and After Effects. I use these programs mostly because they are great for making art. I have used some of these programs since I was a junior in high school.</p>

	<p>I usually start a project by thinking about random things. It tends to help me sometimes to not actually think about the project, but rather other things. It is kind of like Phineas and Ferbs way with coming up with ideas. I also like to look at what other people did in their own projects so that maybe I can get some ideas from them, so I tend to go on youtube a lot. I do not like to make my own vvideo content, as I am not good at it, but instead I prefer to get content from other sources and editing them a lot to make a video.</h3>
